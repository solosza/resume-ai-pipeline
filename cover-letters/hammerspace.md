Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the QA System Architect position at Hammerspace.

I am looking for a company that is ready to integrate AI into QA workflows. In my recent work, I built a custom MCP server that enables AI to orchestrate test generation, page analysis, and automated failure reporting. This sits on top of a 4 layer test architecture where each layer has a single responsibility. I believe AI will fundamentally change how we approach test automation and I want to be part of a team that shares that vision.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience
aligns with Hammerspace's needs.

Sincerely,
Alain Ignacio
