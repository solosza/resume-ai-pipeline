# AI Residency Resume Project - Context & Requirements

## Project Overview
Creating a specialized resume for an AI Residency program application in Las Vegas. This is NOT a traditional job application - it's a 3-month intensive residency program for recent graduates, but we're adapting the approach to highlight AI builder experience despite having 15+ years of professional experience.

## Application Context

### Program Details
- **Program:** AI Residency (3-month intensive, full-time, in-person)
- **Location:** Las Vegas (housing provided)
- **Target Audience:** Recent graduates with either 4.0 GPA OR extraordinary achievement
- **Philosophy:** Focus on "producers" who create tangible value, not just learners
- **Outcome:** Path to full-time paid role after proving value in 90 days

### Key Program Values
- **Producer mindset** - Creating tangible outcomes, not just learning
- **Hands-on AI work** - Building real tools, not theory
- **Grit & adaptability** - "Figure-it-out" mentality
- **Long hours** - Willingness to chase opportunities
- **Daily accountability** - End each day with progress report
- **Real impact** - Solve real problems with AI

### Application Requirements
1. **Resume or LinkedIn profile link** (we're creating GitHub-hosted HTML resume)
2. **5-minute video introduction** (covers experience gap, shows builder mindset)
3. **Short answer:** What problems interest you / what are you obsessed with?
4. **Basic info:** Name, contact, location, availability

## Strategy & Positioning

### The Challenge
- Applicant has 15+ years of professional QA experience
- Program explicitly targets "recent graduates"
- Need to position as extraordinary achievement pathway, not traditional career progression

### The Opportunity
- **Already in Las Vegas** (no relocation needed)
- **Hands-on AI projects** (Make.com/Relevance AI agent system, Zillow automation)
- **Producer track record** (built QA functions from scratch multiple times)
- **AI integration experience** (Claude Code, multi-LLM workflows in production)
- **Self-directed learner** (all AI work self-taught, not corporate training)

### Positioning Strategy
**Frame as: Career transition from QA automation → AI engineering**

**Key Messages:**
1. **Builder, not just manager** - Emphasize hands-on technical work, de-emphasize team management
2. **AI producer** - Show real projects with tangible outcomes
3. **Self-taught AI practitioner** - All AI work done independently, showing initiative
4. **Las Vegas local** - Already here, no logistics issues
5. **Seeking intensive learning** - Want to accelerate AI engineering skills through immersive program

## Resume Requirements

### Format Decision: GitHub-Hosted HTML Resume
**Why:**
- Shows technical competence (you host code, not upload PDF)
- Easy to share (clean URL)
- Showcases work (can link to project repos)
- Producer signal (built custom vs. template)
- Fast implementation (single HTML file)

**Implementation:**
- Create single `index.html` file with embedded CSS
- Host on GitHub Pages
- URL format: `https://[username].github.io/ai-residency-resume`
- Mobile responsive, clean modern design

### Resume Structure (Projects-First Approach)

**NOT using standard professional resume format. This is builder-focused.**

#### Section Order:
1. **Header** - Name, contact, location (Las Vegas), GitHub/LinkedIn links
2. **About / Summary** (Brief, 2-3 sentences)
   - AI builder transitioning from QA automation
   - Hands-on experience with LLMs, automation, agent systems
   - Producer mindset, self-taught, seeking intensive AI engineering focus
3. **AI PROJECTS** ⭐ (This goes FIRST, most prominent)
   - Project 1: Multi-Phase AI Agent System
   - Project 2: Real Estate Automation with AI-Assisted Development
4. **Relevant Experience** (Condensed, de-emphasized)
   - Focus on building/technical work, not management
   - Helios Digital - AI integration in QA
   - Nakupuna - Framework building from scratch
   - (Skip or drastically condense HMSA and IBM)
5. **Technical Skills**
   - AI tools first
   - Programming/frameworks second
   - Methodologies last

### Video Introduction (5 minutes)
**Structure:**
1. **Opening (30 sec):** Hi, I'm Alain, AI builder based in Las Vegas
2. **Last 3 years (2 min):** 
   - Built QA automation functions from scratch
   - Started integrating AI tools into workflows
   - Taught myself AI development (Claude Code, LLMs, agent systems)
   - Built real projects (show enthusiasm)
3. **Why this residency (1.5 min):**
   - Want intensive AI engineering focus
   - Producer mindset - I build things
   - Already in Las Vegas, ready to start
   - Excited about hands-on AI work and mentorship
4. **What I bring (1 min):**
   - Technical foundation (Python, frameworks, APIs)
   - Self-directed learner
   - Proven ability to build from zero
   - Grit and figure-it-out mentality

### Problems/Obsessions Answer
**Focus areas to mention:**
- AI-assisted development and how LLMs change software creation
- Multi-agent systems and orchestration
- Practical AI applications (not just theory)
- Automation and efficiency through AI
- Making AI accessible to non-technical users

**Example response:**
"I'm obsessed with AI-assisted development and multi-agent systems. I want to understand how to build practical AI tools that solve real problems - not just chat with LLMs, but architect systems where agents work together to accomplish complex tasks. I'm particularly interested in orchestration platforms (Make.com, n8n) and how to structure prompts and workflows to get reliable, production-quality outputs. During the residency, I'd love to focus on building multi-agent systems for real-world applications - whether that's document processing, data analysis, or automation workflows. I think we're at this incredible moment where anyone who understands how to guide LLMs can build powerful tools, and I want to be at the forefront of figuring out the best practices for this new way of developing software."

The HTML resume should feel like a **developer portfolio**, not a corporate resume PDF converted to HTML.

Good luck! 🚀
