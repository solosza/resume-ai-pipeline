## Notes for AI Resume Generation

### Content Selection Guidelines

**For AI-focused roles (ai_specialist, ai_engineer, ml_engineer, ai_residency):**
- Projects order: Resume Generator, Multi-Agent System, Real Estate Automation
- Experience bullets: Use `ai_focused` variants
- Skills order: AI Tools → Automation Platforms → Programming → Testing
- Section order: Header → About → Projects → Experience → Skills

**For QA/Automation roles (qa_engineer, sdet, automation_engineer):**
- Projects order: Real Estate Automation, Resume Generator, Multi-Agent System
- Experience bullets: Use `technical` variants
- Skills order: Testing → Programming → API → AI Tools
- Section order: Header → About → Experience → Projects → Skills

**For Technical Leadership roles (qa_lead, engineering_manager):**
- Projects order: Resume Generator, Multi-Agent System, Real Estate Automation
- Experience bullets: Use `management` variants
- Skills order: Methodologies → Testing → AI Tools → Programming
- Section order: Header → About → Experience → Projects → Skills

### Tag Filtering Logic

**Tags to filter by:**
- `ai` - AI engineering, machine learning, LLM work
- `automation` - Workflow automation, orchestration
- `technical` - Hands-on coding, framework building
- `qa` - Quality assurance, testing focus
- `management` - Team leadership, scaling
- `claude-code` - AI-assisted development
- `python` - Python-heavy work
- `api` - API testing and integration

### Professional Summary Guidelines

**CRITICAL - Avoid These Mistakes:**
- ❌ DO NOT mimic job description language verbatim
- ❌ DO NOT start with ANY job title or role label (not "QA Leader", "AI Developer", "Quality Engineer", "Principal Engineer", etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT use the job title from the JD anywhere in the summary
- ❌ DO NOT include years of experience (e.g., "15+ years") - AI tell
- ❌ DO NOT copy job-specific keywords or phrases (e.g., if JD says "data pipeline testing," don't use that exact phrase)
- ❌ DO NOT optimize by adding JD-specific terminology - stay general and capability-focused
- ❌ DO NOT mention specific performance testing tools (JMeter, LoadRunner, etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT mention specific scripting languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT highlight CI/CD in professional summary - it's baseline, not a differentiator
- ❌ DO NOT keyword-stuff or sound robotic
- ❌ DO NOT use dashes " - " anywhere in resume content (AI-generated content indicator)
  - Use colons ":" instead: "Claude Code (Anthropic: AI-assisted development)"
  - Not dashes: "Claude Code (Anthropic - AI-assisted development)"

**DO Use These Principles:**
- ✅ Start directly with experience and capabilities, NOT with a job title or role label
- ✅ Keep high-level and capability-focused
- ✅ Use authentic, natural language
- ✅ Emphasize: building from ground up, scaling teams, AI integration (for leadership roles)
- ✅ Show: types of organizations (startups/enterprise), impact, breadth of experience
- ✅ Technical details belong in Skills and Experience sections, not summary

**Example Professional Summary Patterns:**

**Pattern (AI-focused roles):**
```
Integrating coding agents directly into QA workflows while most teams are still using AI as a chat assistant on the side. Building production systems with Claude Code and custom MCP servers that replace manual bottlenecks with intelligent automation. Background establishing quality functions from ground up across startups, government contracts, and enterprise healthcare.
```

**Pattern (Leadership roles):**
```
Establishing [function] from ground up across [org types].
Strong technical foundation in [general capability] combined with proven ability to [key achievements].
Recently integrated AI tools (Claude Code, GPT-5, Gemini) into [workflows] to [benefits].
Track record of [leadership impact] and delivering [infrastructure type] that supports [impact].
```

**Pattern (IC/Technical roles):**
```
Hands on experience building [technical systems/capabilities].
Demonstrated expertise in [skills] through practical projects and production deployments.
Strong foundation in [technologies].
[Domain] background with experience in [relevant systems].
[Mindset/approach] focused on [outcomes].
```

**Good Example (Leadership role):**
"Establishing quality engineering functions from ground up across startups and enterprise organizations. Strong technical foundation in test automation combined with proven ability to build custom testing frameworks, scale engineering teams, and drive quality practices across complex system architectures. Recently integrated AI tools (Claude Code, GPT-5, Gemini) into testing workflows to accelerate development and eliminate manual bottlenecks. Track record of mentoring engineers and delivering testing infrastructure that supports mission critical applications."

**Good Example (IC/Technical role):**
"Hands on experience building generative AI systems, multi agent architectures, and LLM integration workflows. Demonstrated expertise in prompt engineering, AI model implementation, and healthcare informatics through practical projects and production deployments. Strong foundation in Python development, API integration, and data architecture design. Healthcare industry background with claims processing systems, EDI transactions, and HL7 FHIR standards. Research oriented mindset focused on exploring emerging AI technologies and their practical applications in healthcare operations and treatment optimization."

**Bad Example (DO NOT USE):**
"Performance and Quality Engineering Lead with 15+ years building end-to-end testing frameworks and performance validation strategies for enterprise-scale applications using JMeter, LoadRunner, and Selenium. Expert in Python and JavaScript automation..."
- ❌ Copies JD language ("end-to-end," "performance validation strategies")
- ❌ Mentions specific tools (JMeter, LoadRunner, Selenium)
- ❌ Lists scripting languages (Python, JavaScript)

### Experience Condensing Rules

**Helios Digital Title Selection:**
- **For IC roles** (Senior QA Engineer, Principal QA Engineer, SDET, Test Engineer, etc.): Use **"Senior QA Engineer"**
