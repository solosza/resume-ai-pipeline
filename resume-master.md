- `api` - API testing and integration

### Factual Constraints (NEVER Claim These)

**CRITICAL: These are things Alain has NOT done. Never include these in any resume, professional summary, or experience bullet:**

- ⚠️ **CI/CD pipeline integration** - Limited experience: integrated API tests into Azure DevOps pipelines, but not extensive. Do NOT position as a core strength or lead with it. Note: GitHub (version control, repos, PRs) is NOT the same as GitHub Actions (CI/CD automation). Has not used GitHub Actions.
- ❌ **Parallel test execution** - Has not implemented parallel execution in frameworks
- ❌ **Ecommerce experience** - Has not worked in ecommerce domain
- ❌ **Performance/load testing** - Has not done JMeter, LoadRunner, k6, or similar
- ❌ **Mobile testing** - Has not done Appium, mobile automation
- ❌ **Cloud infrastructure** - Has not done AWS, Azure, GCP test infrastructure
- ❌ **Kubernetes/Docker** - Has not containerized test frameworks
- ❌ **Security testing** - Has not done penetration testing, OWASP, security scanning

**What IS true:**
- ✅ Built frameworks from scratch (Helios, Nakupuna)
- ✅ Scaled teams (0 to 2 at Helios, 0 to 4 at Nakupuna)
- ✅ AI integration via Claude Code and MCP
- ✅ Python/Selenium/pytest infrastructure
- ✅ Page Object Model, data-driven design
- ✅ API testing with Postman
- ✅ Healthcare domain (HMSA)
- ✅ Government/Navy ERP (Nakupuna)
- ✅ Startup environment (Helios)
- ✅ Reporting infrastructure (pytest-html, custom dashboards)
- ✅ Azure DevOps (user stories, test management, basic CI/CD for API tests)

---

### Professional Summary Guidelines

**CRITICAL - Avoid These Mistakes:**
- ❌ DO NOT mimic job description language verbatim
- ❌ DO NOT start with ANY job title or role label (not "QA Leader", "AI Developer", "Quality Engineer", "Principal Engineer", etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT use the job title from the JD anywhere in the summary
- ❌ DO NOT include years of experience (e.g., "15+ years") - AI tell
- ❌ DO NOT copy job-specific keywords or phrases (e.g., if JD says "data pipeline testing," don't use that exact phrase)
- ❌ DO NOT optimize by adding JD-specific terminology - stay general and capability-focused
- ❌ DO NOT mention specific performance testing tools (JMeter, LoadRunner, etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT mention specific scripting languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT highlight CI/CD in professional summary - it's baseline, not a differentiator
- ❌ DO NOT keyword-stuff or sound robotic
- ❌ DO NOT use dashes " - " anywhere in resume content (AI-generated content indicator)
  - Use colons ":" instead: "Claude Code (Anthropic: AI-assisted development)"
  - Not dashes: "Claude Code (Anthropic - AI-assisted development)"

**DO Use These Principles:**
- ✅ Start directly with experience and capabilities, NOT with a job title or role label
- ✅ Keep high-level and capability-focused
- ✅ Use authentic, natural language
- ✅ Emphasize: building from ground up, scaling teams, AI integration (for leadership roles)
- ✅ Show: types of organizations (startups/enterprise), impact, breadth of experience
- ✅ Technical details belong in Skills and Experience sections, not summary

**Writing Flow & Structure (CRITICAL):**
- ❌ DO NOT start sentences with gerunds alone ("Establishing...", "Building...", "Integrating...")
- ✅ Start with proper subjects: "Experienced in establishing...", "This includes...", "Most recently,..."
- ❌ DO NOT repeat "I" at the start of consecutive sentences ("I build... I recently... I have...")
- ✅ Use transitional phrases to connect sentences naturally:
  - "This includes..." (connects to previous statement)
  - "Most recently,..." (temporal transition)
  - "Background spans..." (summary closer)
- ❌ DO NOT repeat the same information (e.g., listing domains in first AND last sentence)
- ✅ Introduce general context first, then get specific at the end
- ✅ Vary sentence structure for natural rhythm
- ✅ Each sentence should flow logically from the previous one

**Header Links (ALWAYS include):**
- ✅ ALWAYS include "Web Resume" link in header contact section
- Format: `<a href="https://solosza.github.io/resume-ai-pipeline/resumes/[filename].html" target="_blank">Web Resume</a>`
- Place after GitHub link in contact/links section
- This allows recruiters to view the live, formatted version

**Project Date Display:**
- ❌ DO NOT include dates on personal projects in generated resumes
- Projects section should show tech stack only, no date metadata
- Dates are stored in master data for reference but omitted from output

**Claude Code Inclusion Logic:**
- **AI-forward roles** (JD mentions AI/LLM, AI agents, emerging tech, or asks for AI opinions): Include Claude Code prominently in professional summary and relevant bullets. These are the hiring managers who will recognize it.
- **Traditional QA/SDET roles** (no AI emphasis in JD): Skip Claude Code mentions. Keep focus on frameworks, architecture, automation. May confuse or distract.
- **Startup/Innovation roles** (even without explicit AI ask): Include if company culture suggests early adopter mindset. Signals you're ahead of the curve.
- **Where to include when applicable:**
  1. Professional summary: "using Claude Code and custom MCP servers"
  2. Helios bullets already mention it in ai_focused variant
  3. Skills section under AI Tools (always present, reader can ignore if unfamiliar)

**Professional Summary Variants:**

**ai_focused** (for AI engineer, AI residency, AI adoption roles):
```
Experienced in integrating coding agents directly into QA workflows while most teams are still using AI as a chat assistant on the side. This includes building production systems with Claude Code and custom MCP servers that replace manual bottlenecks with intelligent automation across startups, government contracts, and enterprise healthcare environments.
```

**technical** (for SDET, Automation Engineer, QA Engineer roles):
```
Experienced in establishing test automation functions from scratch and designing automation frameworks across regulated healthcare, Navy ERP, and early stage startup environments. This includes building custom frameworks with layered architecture that teams adopted beyond QA into development workflows. Most recently, integrated AI coding agents via MCP servers to automate test generation, failure analysis, and reporting.
```

**management** (for QA Lead, QA Manager, Director roles):
```
Experienced in establishing quality engineering functions from scratch across startups and enterprise organizations. This includes building custom testing frameworks that teams adopted beyond QA into development workflows, along with driving quality practices across complex system architectures. Most recently, integrated AI tools into team workflows to accelerate development and eliminate manual bottlenecks.
```

**rpa_developer** (for RPA Developer, Intelligent Automation, Process Automation roles):
```
Experienced in integrating automation frameworks and coding agents to remove repetitive work from complex business workflows. This includes building custom Python based UI automation systems for ERP, healthcare, and startup environments, then extending them with AI assisted tooling through Model Context Protocol. Background spans enterprise grade test automation, data driven workflows, and AI assisted development patterns that map naturally to document and form driven processes.
```

**Bad Example (DO NOT USE):**
"Performance and Quality Engineering Lead with 15+ years building end-to-end testing frameworks and performance validation strategies for enterprise-scale applications using JMeter, LoadRunner, and Selenium. Expert in Python and JavaScript automation..."
- ❌ Copies JD language ("end-to-end," "performance validation strategies")
- ❌ Mentions specific tools (JMeter, LoadRunner, Selenium)
- ❌ Lists scripting languages (Python, JavaScript)

### Experience Condensing Rules
